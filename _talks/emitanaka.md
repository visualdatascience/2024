bio: |
    Dr. Emi Tanaka is a Senior Lecturer in Statistics at the Biological Data Science Institute (and the Research School of Finance, Actuarial Studies and Statistics) at the Australian National University. Her primary interest is to develop impactful methods and tools that can be readily used by practitioners. She interfaces across multiple disciplines to bridge statistical concepts and findings to a broad range of individuals. To this end, she has developed numerous open-source tools, primarily as R-packages, and resources aimed at making statistical methods accessible to a diverse audience. Emi demonstrates a proactive approach to community development and education through her involvement in the branches of the Statistical Society of Australia (SSA) and other committees. She is the current Vice-President of the SSA Victoria & Tasmanian Branch. Her contributions are recognised with the SSA Distinguished Presenter's Award, SSA Presidentâ€™s Award for Leadership in Statistics, and being featured in the list of 60 prominent Australian statisticians in the Significance magazine.

abstract: | 
    Visualisation captivates one of our primal senses, i.e. the sight, but we need to engage our cognition to interpret its meaning. In that sense, we cannot, and should not, decouple statistical thinking from data visualisation, nor should we overlook the role of visualisation in statistical thinking. In this talk, I will share cases where reciprocal cooperation is beneficial to us and others around us.
