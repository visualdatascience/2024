bio: |
    Marcus Beck is the Senior Scientist for the Tampa Bay Estuary Program in St. Petersburg, Florida and is developing data analysis and visualization methods for Bay health indicators. Marcus has experience researching environmental indicators and developing open science products to support decision-making in aquatic environments around the country, including Minnesota lakes, Florida estuaries, and California streams. He has been using the R statistical programming language for over 15 years and has taught several workshops on its application to environmental sciences. Marcus has also developed several R packages and currently maintains 9 on CRAN. He received a PhD in Conservation Biology with a minor in Statistics from the University of Minnesota in 2013, his Masters in Conservation Biology from the University of Minnesota in 2009, and his Bachelors in Zoology from the University of Florida in 2007.

abstract: | 
    The Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) has provided over 30 years of support to manage one of Floridaâ€™s most precious environmental resources. As one of 28 similar programs in the United States, the TBEP works to achieve consensus on the most scientifically-robust approaches to inform environmental management for Tampa Bay. The TBEP has embraced open science visualization practices as one of its core strategic priorities to improve how research applications bridge the gap between the scientific community and decision makers. These efforts have included modernizing historical reporting workflows and developing novel bay health indicators with robust visualization techniques in a cloud-based environment. In addition to supporting a healthy Tampa Bay, these visualization workflows are documented in a reproducible framework to support future management efforts and to avoid past mistakes of information loss as the program evolves. Much is still needed from the data visualization community to understand how to leverage cutting-edge techniques for the benefit of Tampa Bay and beyond.
