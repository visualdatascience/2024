bio: |
    Arvind Satyanarayan is the NBX Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the MIT EECS department and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL). He leads the MIT Visualization Group which uses data visualization as a petri dish to study intelligence augmentation (IA), or how software systems can help amplify our cognition and creativity while respecting our agency. His work has been recognized with an NSF CAREER award and a Google Research Scholar award, best paper awards at premier academic venues (e.g., ACM CHI and IEEE VIS), and by practitioners (e.g., with an Information is Beautiful Award nomination). Visualization toolkits and systems he has developed with collaborators are widely used in industry (including at Apple, Google, and Microsoft), on Wikipedia, and in the Jupyter/Observable data science communities. Between 2018â€“2020, he served as a co-editor of Distill, an academic journal devoted to clarity in machine learning research.
abstract: |
    As machine learning models are increasingly deployed into real-world contexts, the need for interpretability grows more urgent. In order to hold models accountable for the outcomes they produce, we cannot rely on quantitative measures of accuracy alone; rather, we also need to be able to qualitatively inspect how they operate. To meet this challenge, recent years have seen an explosion of research developing techniques and systems to interpret model behavior. But, are we making meaningful progress on this issue? In this talk, I will give us a language for answering this question by drawing on frameworks in human-computer interaction (HCI) and by analogizing to the progress of research in data visualization. I will use this language to characterize existing work (including work my research group is currently conducting) and sketch out directions for future work.
