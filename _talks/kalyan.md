bio: |
    Dr. Kalyan Veeramachaneni is a Principal Research Scientist at the Laboratory for Information and Decision System (LIDS) at MIT. He directs a research group called Data to AI in the new MIT Schwarzman College of Computing. His group focuses on building large-scale AI systems that work alongside humans, continuously learning from data, generating predictions and integrating those predictions into human decision-making. The group develops foundational algorithms, abstractions, and systems to enable these three tasks at scale. Algorithms, systems and open-source software developed by the group are deployed for applications in the financial, medical, and education sectors.   Kalyan was the co-founder of PatternEx (acq. by Corelight), a cybersecurity company that adapts machine learning models based on real-time analyst feedback. He was also the co-founder of FeatureLabs (acq. by Alteryx), a data science automation company. He is currently a co-founder of DataCebo which focuses on improving data access and availability through synthetic data generation. Kalyan has published over 70 publications and his work on AI-driven solutions for data science and cybersecurity has been covered by major media outlets, including the Washington Post, CBS News, Wired, Forbes and Newsweek. He received his Masters in Computer Engineering and Ph.D in Electrical Engineering in 2009, both from Syracuse University. He joined MIT in 2009.
