    Tamara Munzner is a Professor at the University of British Columbia Department of Computer Science, and holds a 2000 PhD from Stanford. She has been active in visualization research since 1991 and has published over ninety papers and chapters. She has been papers chair for IEEE InfoVis, EuroVis, and VIS, on the steering committees for InfoVis and BioVis, and the chair of the VIS Executive Committee. Her book Visualization Analysis and Design is widely used to teach visualization world-wide, and she is the co-editor of the A K Peters Visualization book series at CRC/Routledge. She received the IEEE VGTC Visualization Technical Achievement Award, multiple Test of Time Awards from InfoVis, and is an IEEE Fellow.

abstract: | 
    I'll frame visualization for data science through a set of metaphorical questions that are easy to state, but tricky to answer: Where are we? What's here? What's nearby? Are we there yet? Data reconnaissance and task wrangling is a conceptual framework for investigating where we are in complex and unfamiliar data landscape, through a four-phase cycle of acquire, view, assess, pursue. Recommendation through automatically generated layouts can shed light on that data landscape, and determining the right similarity measures is a way to operationalize the meaning of nearby. "Are we there yet?" is a question that's not just for road trips: it can apply to the training of a machine learning system.
